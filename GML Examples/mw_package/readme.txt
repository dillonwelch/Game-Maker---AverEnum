Multiple Window system
By DXsmiley

The Multiple Window system (or MWS) lets you add extra windows to you Game maker games without any extentions or DLLs. Though you will need an average knolege on GML to use it.

How the system works.
Each window is actually a seperate program, and they all comunicate by a contrandly changing ini file.

All scripts contain a description of what they do, and because the system is so simple you should be able to work it out.

An example game (with gmk) has been included. To play it execute pong_launcher.exe NOT pong_a.exe or pong_b.exe

Game-Maker---AverEnum
=====================
This is my GitHub repo for the game AverEnum, created for an independent study class under Dr. Christian Duncan in May 2012 at Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, Louisiana. It is a real-time RPG with heavy influences from games like Avernum by Spiderweb Software (hence the name AverEnum, or Avernum Enumeration).
